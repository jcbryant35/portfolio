                    <p>
                        Jez Variety Trend is my second
                        published website, it's a products
                        display website. It was created 
                        when a client reached out to me 
                        to help them simplify their products
                        advertising.<br><br>
                        Before reaching out to me, the client
                        explained they were just starting up
                        their business and listing their products
                        on social media daily and instead they
                        wanted to have a website to display
                        all of their products and pricing so 
                        they could just share one link to 
                        customers and be able to view all
                        of their products in one place.

                        <p>
                            The client has recently contacted
                            me about the success they have had
                            with the products display website.
                            <br><br>
                            We are currently discussing
                            turning it into a full-blown 
                            e-commerce store with a shopping
                            cart, an online payment system, 
                            shipping system, and create user login accounts.
                            <br><br>
                            There will also be a dashboard for admins
                            to add/edit products and pricing,
                            and keep track of sales and inventory. It
                            will also undergo a slight design change.
